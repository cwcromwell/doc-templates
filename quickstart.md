## What is a quickstart



## The main body should follow these guidelines.  

* It should be a clear, concise, step-by-step tutorial (A set of numbered steps)
* It should describe the easiest way to use the API, as opposed to the most optimized production modes or most advanced uses 
* It should be explaining the basic operations that most users will want to perform on the site, or the operations they will perform first. 
* Each step should contain all the information necessary to complete it. And the Quickstart should not contain any additional info that is not needed--because it will be easier to understand if it is as brief as possible. 
* It should include code samples (examples) that users can copy and paste. For each step that the user has to perform. (If it's an API)
* Each example should be explained in comments that follow directly after the example, so newcomers can quickly understand how the API works 

## The quickstart should not include: 

* Setup information
* Things that belong in the reference section, like authentication, throttling, error codes, a complete description of any feature.
* Things that belong in the overview (a general description of the product; what it can do; what it can't do)
