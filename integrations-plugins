An integration (or plug-in) is a bit of code provided to a cloud service (GitHub action, GitLab runners, Jenkins, etc.) so that customers of tha service can easily deploy the plug in and run your software in an automated way, often without having to write a script.

   * What is the basic workflow for configuration. (Ordered list of steps for high-level understanding. Not the complete instructions)

3.) How to configure the plug-in
