# The administration guide

## How to organize it

Administration guides are often organized the wrong way. An administration guide should be organized by the phases of acquiring, installing, and using the software. 

Don't organize according to any of these: 

* The order of steps used the first time the software or hardware is set up. This  This will make the guide hard to follow when you come back later to change settings and the order of the guide doesn't make much sense. 
* The way features are grouped in the software.

Both of these schemes will make it difficult for users to find features. They might also make it difficult for the writer to decide where to insert new material.
