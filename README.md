# doc-templates
Templates for creating API documentation.

## About This Project
This repo contains templates that will make it easier to get started with software documentation. I noticed that software engineers often have questions about what kind of document to produce when they turn up at Write The Docs events. When they start to create docs, they want to know the simplest way to get the task done and have some useful documentation. If that sounds familiar, keep reading. 

Here are some reasons to use a template if you're an engineer: 

* Other people have already figured out which documents you should create to meet the minimum requirements of your users. You can benefit from community knowledge and save a lot of time.
* The templates also tell you _what content_ each document should contain, and in some cases explain why.
* You will save a lot of time, because you can outsource the design of your docset and focus on writing the technical details about how your API works.
* If you follow the simple recipe that I and many others have arrived at, you'll produce documentation that gets the right results: 
   - time saved for your end users, both in learning your tool and in getting tasks completed
   - reduced frustration
   - faster and easier adoption of your software

(These templates can also be helpful in many ways if you're a technical writer, but I'll save that unordered list for another day.)

If you are a software engineer and you need additional help to get going with these (like suggested workflows or a better explanation of how to use the templates) please let me know what additional help you need by opening an issue. 

I intend to submit these templates to other projects that are building larger collections of templates, or that are building training resources. When I do that, I'll post links to the other resources here. 

In the meantime, help yourself. 

## The Full Set of Templates

The current set of templates describes the documentation required for an API. Here's a list of those guides, and some more information about each. 

Template Name | Description 
------------- | -------------------------------------------- 
Reference | An exhaustive listing of all the endpoints, including a consistently formatted listing of all the parameters for each endpoint. 
Quickstart | A workflow that describes the simplest way to get whatever benefit the API offers. 
Overview | Basic information about what the service does and does not do. What problem it was designed to solve. How it works, in general. 
Setup | How to install or configure your environment to ensure that the service works. 

Each template contains a short discussion of why the document is needed and what it is designed to accomplish. Take a look at all the templates before you get started.
