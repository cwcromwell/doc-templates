# doc-templates
Templates for creating API documentation.

This repo contains templates that will make it easier to get started with software documentation. I noticed that software engineers often have questions about what kind of document to produce when they turn up at Write The Docs events. When they create docs, they want the kind of help that will show them the simplest way to get the task done and have some useful documentation. This project was conceived because of those requests. 

Here are some reasons to use a template if you're an engineer: 

* I've already figured out which documents you should create to meet the minimum requirements of your users
* The templates also tell you _what content_ each document should contain, and in some cases explain why.
* You will save a lot of time, because you can outsource the design of your docset and focus on the part that you are expert on, which is the technical information about how your API works. 

(This can also be helpful if you're a technical writer, but I'll save that unordered list for another day.)

If you are a software engineer and you need additional help to get going with these (like suggested workflows or a better explanation of how to use these templates) please let me know what additional help you need by opening an issue or sending me an email. 

I intend to submit these templates to other projects that are building larger collections of templates, or that are building training resources. When I do that, I'll post links to the other resources here. 

In the meantime, help yourself, and feel free to make a suggestion by opening an issue.
