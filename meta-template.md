# The Meta-Template


This is the outline for creating new templates. 

It's mainly for the owner and potential contributors to this repo. But contact me by opening an issue before you attempt a pull request. (I'm creating these to contribute to other projects, so you might want to go directly to those with your contributions.)


## Template summary 

* Purpose of the document 
* Who it is for
* When and why does one need to use this document? (What justifies it as a critical document in the minimum viable doc set?)

## Contents

What tasks must be completed (installation, configuring the environment?)
What this Quickstart will help the reader accomplish
Where to get tokens or API keys, etc. if needed

This template was the predecessor to one that is under construction at The Good Docs Project: 
https://github.com/thegooddocsproject

Their template will be slightly longer than this one, and you should go to their repo to see all the details.
